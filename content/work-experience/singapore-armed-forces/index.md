In the second year of my compulsory National Service at Singapore, I worked as a software developer. In this time,  developed and rolled out multiple modules and apps for the Singapore Armed Forces such as

- [NRIC utils](/mini-project/nric-utils)
- [IPPT utils](/mini-project/ippt-utils)
- MT-RAC+


## MT-RAC+

A plethora of technologies including Vue, Express, Prisma were used, and I was introduced to AWS.
